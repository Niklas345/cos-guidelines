# cos-guidelines
There is required and optional parts. _Optional part to be added later_
## Required part
1. Only "modern" syntax permitted, dotted syntax is not generally allowed (with few exceptions)
2. No short name for statements keywords allowed - use fully expanded, lower case keyword names
 
```

  do ##class(Sample).%New(initexpresion)
   for i=1:1:10 {
    write something,!
  }
 }
